# Streamlet-Mini-Course
Make Websites With ONLY Python

In this mini course, you'll learn about Streamlit, a fantastic Python UI library that allows you to make interfaces very quickly. I'll be showing you how to build an entire website in just a few minutes, and cover all of the graphical components like forms, models, charts, and buttons. Not only that, I'll also explain the more advanced features of Streamlit such as the architecture and how things are rendered so you can build more complex applications. This mini course will show everything you need to know and how easy it is to build websites and interfaces in purely Python.
